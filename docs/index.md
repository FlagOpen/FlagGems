## About

FlagGems is a high-performance general operator library implemented in [OpenAI Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton). It aims to provide a suite of kernel functions to accelerate LLM training and inference.

By registering with the ATen backend of PyTorch, FlagGems facilitates a seamless transition, allowing users to switch to the Triton function library without the need to modify their model code. Users can still utilize the ATen backend as usual while experiencing significant performance enhancement. The Triton language offers benefits in readability, user-friendliness and performance comparable to CUDA. This convenience allows developers to engage in the development of FlagGems with minimal learning investment.

## Features

### Multi-Backend Hardware Support
FlagGems supports a wide range of hardware platforms and has been extensively tested across different hardware configurations.

### Automatic Codegen
FlagGems provides an automatic code generation mechanism that enables developers to easily generate both pointwise and fused operators.
The auto-generation system supports a variety of needs, including standard element-wise computations, non-tensor parameters, and specifying output types.
For more details, please refer to pointwise_dynamic(pointwise_dynamic.md).

### LibEntry
FlagGems introduces `LibEntry`, which independently manages the kernel cache and bypasses the runtime of `Autotuner`, `Heuristics`, and `JitFunction`. To use it, simply decorate the Triton kernel with LibEntry.

`LibEntry` also supports direct wrapping of `Autotuner`, `Heuristics`, and `JitFunction`, preserving full tuning functionality. However, it avoids nested runtime type invocations, eliminating redundant parameter processing. This means no need for binding or type wrapping, resulting in a simplified cache key format and reduced unnecessary key computation.

### C++ Runtime
FlagGems can be installed either as a pure Python package or as a package with C++ extensions. The C++ runtime is designed to address the overhead of the Python runtime and improve end-to-end performance.
For more details, please refer to [c++ extensions](build_flaggems_with_c_extensions.md).
