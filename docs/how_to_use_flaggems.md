# How To Use FlagGems

## Basic Usage

To use the `FlagGems` operator library, import it and enable acceleration before running computations. You can enable it globally or temporarily.

### Option 1: Global Enablement

To apply `FlagGems` optimizations across your entire script or interactive session:

```python
import flag_gems

# Enable flag_gems globally
flag_gems.enable()
```

Once enabled, all supported operators in your code will automatically be replaced with the optimized `FlagGems` implementations‚Äîno further changes needed.

### Option 2: Scoped Enablement

For finer control, you can enable `FlagGems` only within a specific code block using its context manager:

```python
import flag_gems

# Enable flag_gems temporarily
with flag_gems.use_gems():
    # Code inside this block will use Gems-accelerated operators
    ...

```

This scoped usage is helpful when you want to:

- Benchmark performance differences

- Compare correctness between implementations

- Apply acceleration selectively in complex workflows

## Advanced Usage

The `flag_gems.enable(...)` function supports several optional parameters to give you fine-grained control over how acceleration is applied. This allows for more flexible integration and easier debugging or profiling in complex workflows.

### Parameter Overview

| Parameter      | Type      | Description                                                           |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unused`       | List[str] | Disable specific operators                                            |
| `record`       | bool      | Log operator calls for debugging or profiling                         |
| `path`         | str       | Log file path (only used when `record=True`)                          |

### Example : Selectively Disable Specific Operators

You can use the `unused` parameter to exclude certain operators from being accelerated by `FlagGems`. This is especially useful when a particular operator does not behave as expected in your workload, or if you're seeing suboptimal performance and want to temporarily fall back to the original implementation.

```python
flag_gems.enable(unused=["sum", "add"])
```

With this configuration, `sum` and `add` will continue to use the native PyTorch implementations, while all other supported operators will use `FlagGems` versions.

### Example : Enable Debug Logging

Enable `record=True` to log operator usage during runtime, and specify the output path with `path`.

```python
flag_gems.enable(
    record=True,
    path="./gems_debug.log"
)
```

After running your script, inspect the log file (e.g., `gems_debug.log`) to see which operators were invoked through `flag_gems`.

Sample log content:

```shell
$ cat ./gems_debug.log
[DEBUG] flag_gems.ops.fill: GEMS FILL_SCALAR_
[DEBUG] flag_gems.ops.fill: GEMS FILL_SCALAR_
[DEBUG] flag_gems.ops.mm: GEMS MM
[DEBUG] flag_gems.fused.reshape_and_cache: GEMS RESHAPE_AND_CACHE
```

## Running FlagGems on Non-NVIDIA Hardware

### Supported Platforms

FlagGems supports a range of AI chips beyond NVIDIA. For an up-to-date list of validated platforms, please refer to the following section in our main documentation:
üëâ [See Supported Platforms](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-platforms)

### Unified Usage Interface

Regardless of the underlying hardware, the usage of `flag_gems` remains exactly the same. There is no need to modify application code when switching from NVIDIA to non-NVIDIA platforms.

Once you call `import flag_gems` and enable acceleration via `flag_gems.enable()`, operator dispatch will automatically route to the correct backend. This provides a consistent developer experience across heterogeneous environments.

### Backend Requirements

Although the usage pattern is unchanged, running on non-NVIDIA hardware requires that the underlying dependencies‚Äî**PyTorch** and the **Triton compiler**‚Äîare available and properly configured for the target platform.

There are two common ways to obtain compatible builds:

1. **Request from Hardware Vendor**
   Hardware vendors typically maintain custom builds of PyTorch and Triton tailored to their chips. Contact the vendor to request the appropriate versions.

2. **Explore the FlagTree Project**
   The [FlagTree project](https://github.com/FlagTree/flagtree) offers a unified Triton compiler infrastructure that supports a range of AI chips, including NVIDIA and non-NVIDIA platforms. It consolidates vendor-specific patches and enhancements into a shared open-source backend, simplifying compiler maintenance and enabling multi-platform compatibility.

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è FlagTree provides Triton only. A matching PyTorch build is still required separately.

> **Note**: Some platforms may require additional setup or patching.

### Backend Auto-Detection and Manual Setting

By default, `flag_gems` automatically detects the current hardware backend at runtime and selects the corresponding implementation. In most cases, no manual configuration is required, and everything works out of the box.

However, if auto-detection fails or is incompatible with your environment, you can manually set the target backend to ensure correct runtime behavior. To do this, set the following environment variable before running your code:

```
export GEMS_VENDOR=<your_vendor_name>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This setting should match the actual hardware platform. Manually setting an incorrect backend may result in runtime errors.

You can verify the active backend at runtime using:

```
import flag_gems
print(flag_gems.vendor_name)
```

## Integration with Popular Frameworks

To help integrate `flag_gems` into real-world scenarios, we provide examples with widely-used deep learning frameworks. These integrations require minimal code changes and preserve the original workflow structure.

For full examples, see the [`examples/`](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems/tree/master/examples) directory.

### Example 1: Hugging Face Transformers

Integration with Hugging Face's `transformers` library is straightforward ‚Äî simply follow the basic usage patterns introduced in previous sections.

During inference, you can activate acceleration without modifying the model or tokenizer logic. Here's a minimal example:

```
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import flag_gems

# Load tokenizer and model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sharpbai/Llama-2-7b-hf")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("sharpbai/Llama-2-7b-hf")

# Move model to correct device and set to eval mode
device = flag_gems.device
model.to(device).eval()

# Prepare input and run inference with flag_gems enabled
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device=device)
with flag_gems.use_gems():
    output = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100, num_beams=5)
```

This pattern ensures that all compatible operators used during generation will be automatically accelerated.
You can find more examples in the following files:

- `examples/model_llama_test.py`
- `examples/model_llava_test.py`

### Example 2: vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput inference engine designed for serving large language models efficiently. It supports features like paged attention, continuous batching, and optimized memory management.

`flag_gems` can be integrated into vLLM to replace both standard PyTorch (`aten`) ops and vLLM's internal custom kernels.

#### Replacing Standard PyTorch Operators in vLLM

To accelerate standard PyTorch ops (e.g., `add`, `masked_fill`) in vLLM, simply use the same approach as in other frameworks:

- Call `flag_gems.enable()` before any model initialization or inference.
- This overrides all compatible PyTorch `aten` ops, including those indirectly used in vLLM.

#### Replacing vLLM-Specific Custom Operators

To further optimize vLLM‚Äôs internal kernels, `flag_gems` provides an additional API:

```
flag_gems.apply_gems_patches_to_vllm(verbose=True)
```

This function patches certain vLLM-specific C++ or Triton operators with `flag_gems` implementations. When `verbose=True`, it will log which functions were replaced:

```shell
Patched RMSNorm.forward_cuda with FLAGGEMS custom_gems_rms_forward_cuda
Patched RotaryEmbedding.forward_cuda with FLAGGEMS custom_gems_rope_forward_cuda
Patched SiluAndMul.forward_cuda with FLAGGEMS custom_gems_silu_and_mul
```

Use this when more comprehensive `flag_gems` coverage is desired.

#### Full Example: Enable `flag_gems` in vLLM Inference

```
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
import flag_gems

# Step 1: Enable acceleration for PyTorch (aten) operators
flag_gems.enable()

# Step 2: (Optional) Patch vLLM custom ops
flag_gems.apply_gems_patches_to_vllm(verbose=True)

# Step 3: Use vLLM as usual
llm = LLM(model="sharpbai/Llama-2-7b-hf")
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, max_tokens=128)

output = llm.generate("Tell me a joke.", sampling_params)
print(output)
```

### Example 3: Megatron

[Megatron-LM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM) is a highly optimized framework for large-scale language model pretraining and fine-tuning. Due to its tight integration with custom training loops and internal utilities, integrating `flag_gems` into Megatron requires a slightly more targeted approach.

Since Megatron‚Äôs training loop tightly couples distributed data loading, gradient accumulation, and pipeline parallelism, we recommend applying `flag_gems` only around the forward and backward computation stages.

#### Recommended Integration Point

The most reliable way to use `flag_gems` in Megatron is by modifying the `train_step` function in [`megatron/training/training.py`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/blob/main/megatron/training/training.py#L1360).
Specifically, wrap the block where `forward_backward_func` is invoked as shown below:

```
def train_step(forward_step_func, data_iterator, model, optimizer, opt_param_scheduler, config):
    """Single training step."""
    args = get_args()
    timers = get_timers()

     # CUDA Graph capturing logic omitted
    rerun_state_machine = get_rerun_state_machine()
    while rerun_state_machine.should_run_forward_backward(data_iterator):
    	# Gradient zeroing logic omitted

        # Forward pass with flag_gems acceleration
        import flag_gems
        with flag_gems.use_gems():
          forward_backward_func = get_forward_backward_func()
          losses_reduced = forward_backward_func(
              forward_step_func=forward_step_func,
              data_iterator=data_iterator,
              model=model,
              num_microbatches=get_num_microbatches(),
              seq_length=args.seq_length,
              micro_batch_size=args.micro_batch_size,
              decoder_seq_length=args.decoder_seq_length,
              forward_only=False,
              adjust_tensor_shapes_fn=adjust_tensor_shapes_fn,
          )

    should_checkpoint, should_exit, exit_code = rerun_state_machine.should_checkpoint_and_exit()
    if should_exit:
        return {}, True, should_checkpoint, should_exit, exit_code, None, None

    # Other post-step operations omitted
```

This ensures that only the forward and backward computation logic runs with `flag_gems` acceleration, while other components such as data loading and optimizer steps remain unchanged.

#### Scope and Limitations

While `flag_gems.enable()` is sufficient in most frameworks, we observed that applying it early in Megatron‚Äôs pipeline can sometimes cause unexpected behavior, especially during the data loading phase. For better stability, we recommend using `flag_gems.use_gems()` as a context manager limited to the computation stage.

If you wish to accelerate a broader range of components (e.g., optimizer, preprocessing), you may try enabling `flag_gems` globally with `flag_gems.enable()`. However, this approach is less tested and may require additional validation based on your Megatron version.

We encourage community contributions ‚Äî please open an `issue` or submit a PR to help improve broader Megatron integration.

## Multi-GPU Deployment

In real-world LLM deployment scenarios, multi-GPU or multi-node setups are often required to support large model sizes and high-throughput inference. `flag_gems` supports these scenarios by accelerating operator execution across multiple GPUs.

### Single-Node vs Multi-Node Usage

For **single-node deployments**, integration is straightforward‚Äîsimply import and call `flag_gems.enable()` at the beginning of your script. This enables acceleration without requiring any additional changes.

In **multi-node deployments**, however, this approach is insufficient. Distributed inference frameworks (like vLLM) spawn multiple worker processes across nodes, and each process must individually initialize `flag_gems`. If the activation occurs only in the launch script, worker processes on remote nodes will fall back to the default implementation and miss out on acceleration.

### Integration Example: vLLM + DeepSeek

Here‚Äôs how to enable `flag_gems` in a distributed vLLM + DeepSeek deployment:

1. **Baseline Verification**
   Before integrating `flag_gems`, verify that the model can load and serve correctly without it.
   For example, loading a model like `Deepseek-R1` typically requires **at least two H100 GPUs** and can take **up to 20 minutes** to initialize, depending on checkpoint size and system I/O.

2. **Inject `flag_gems` into vLLM Worker Code**
   Locate the appropriate model runner script depending on your vLLM version:

   - If you are using the **vLLM v1 architecture** (available in vLLM ‚â• 0.8), modify `vllm/v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py`
   - If you are using the **legacy v0 architecture**, modify `vllm/worker/model_runner.py`

   In either file, insert the following logic after the last `import` statement:

   ```
   import os
   if os.getenv("USE_FLAGGEMS", "false").lower() in ("1", "true", "yes"):
        try:
            import flag_gems
            flag_gems.enable()
            flag_gems.apply_gems_patches_to_vllm(verbose=True)
            logger.info("Successfully enabled flag_gems as default ops implementation.")
        except ImportError:
            logger.warning("Failed to import 'flag_gems'. Falling back to default implementation.")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Failed to enable 'flag_gems': {e}. Falling back to default implementation.")
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables on All Nodes**
   Before launching the service, ensure all nodes have the following environment variable set:
   ```bash
   export USE_FLAGGEMS=1
   ```
4. **Start Distributed Inference and Confirm Acceleration**
   Launch the service and check the startup logs on each node for messages indicating that operators have been overridden.

```
  Overriding a previously registered kernel for the same operator and the same dispatch key
  operator: aten::add.Tensor(Tensor self, Tensor other, *, Scalar alpha=1) -> Tensor
    registered at /pytorch/build/aten/src/ATen/RegisterSchema.cpp:6
  dispatch key: CUDA
  previous kernel: registered at /pytorch/aten/src/ATen/LegacyBatchingRegistrations.cpp:1079
       new kernel: registered at /dev/null:488 (Triggered internally at /pytorch/aten/src/ATen/core/dispatch/OperatorEntry.cpp:154.)
  self.m.impl(
```

This confirms that `flag_gems` has been successfully enabled across all GPUs.

## Building Custom Models Using Gems Operators

In some scenarios, users may wish to build their own models from scratch or modify existing ones to better suit specific requirements. To support this, `flag_gems` provides a growing collection of high-performance modules commonly used in large language models (LLMs).

These components are implemented using `flag_gems`-accelerated operators and can be used like any standard `torch.nn.Module`. You can seamlessly integrate them into your architecture to benefit from kernel-level acceleration, without writing custom CUDA or Triton code.

Available modules are located in:
[flag_gems/modules](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems/tree/master/src/flag_gems/modules)

### Available Modules

| Module                 | Description                                           | Supported Features                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `GemsRMSNorm`          | RMS LayerNorm                                         | Fused residual add, `inplace` & `outplace` |
| `GemsRope`             | Standard rotary position embedding                    | `inplace` & `outplace`                     |
| `GemsDeepseekYarnRoPE` | RoPE with extrapolation for DeepSeek-style LLMs       | `inplace` & `outplace`                     |
| `GemsSiluAndMul`       | Fused SiLU activation with elementwise multiplication | `outplace` only                            |

We encourage users to use these as drop-in replacements for equivalent PyTorch layers. More components such as fused attention, MoE layers, and transformer blocks are under development ‚Äî see the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for planned modules and release targets.

## Achieving Optimal Performance with Gems

While `flag_gems` kernels are designed for high performance, achieving optimal end-to-end speed in full model deployments requires careful integration and consideration of runtime behavior. In particular, two common performance bottlenecks are:

- **Runtime autotuning overhead** in production environments.
- **Suboptimal dispatching** due to framework-level kernel registration or interaction with the Triton runtime.

These issues can occasionally offset the benefits of highly optimized kernels. To address them, we provide two complementary optimization paths designed to ensure that `flag_gems` operates at peak efficiency in real inference scenarios.

### Pre-tuning Model Shapes for Inference Scenarios

`flag_gems` integrates with [`LibTuner`](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems/blob/master/src/flag_gems/utils/libentry.py#L139), a lightweight enhancement to Triton‚Äôs autotuning system. `libtuner` introduces a **persistent, per-device tuning cache** that helps mitigate runtime overhead from Triton‚Äôs default autotuning process.

#### Why Pre-tuning?

Triton typically performs autotuning during the first few executions of a new input shape, which may cause latency spikes‚Äîespecially in latency-sensitive inference systems. `libtune` addresses this with:

- Persistent caching: Best autotune configs are saved across runs.
- Cross-process sharing: Cache is shared across processes on the same device.
- Reduced runtime overhead: Once tuned, operators skip tuning in future runs.

This is particularly useful for operators like `mm` and `addmm`, which often trigger Triton autotune logic.

#### How to Use Pre-tuning

To proactively warm up your system and populate the cache:

1. Identify key input shapes used in your production workload.
2. Run the pre-tuning script to benchmark and cache best configs:`python examples/pretune.py`
3. Deploy normally, and `flag_gems` will automatically pick the optimal config from cache during inference.

> ‚úÖ `pretune.py` accepts example shapes and workloads to simulate your model's actual use cases. You can customize it for batch sizes, sequence lengths, etc.

> üí° In frameworks like **vLLM** (`v0.8.5+`), enabling `--compile-mode` automatically performs a warmup step. If `flag_gems` is integrated, this also triggers `libtuner`-based pre-tuning implicitly.

For more details or to customize your tuning cache path and settings, refer to the [examples/pretune.py](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems/blob/master/examples/pretune.py).

### Using C++-Based Operator Wrappers for Further Performance Gains

Another advanced optimization path in `flag_gems` is the use of **C++ wrappers** for selected operators. While Triton kernels offer reasonably good compute performance, Triton itself is a Python-embedded DSL. This means that both operator definition and runtime dispatch rely on Python, which can introduce **non-trivial overhead** in latency-sensitive or high-throughput scenarios.

To address this, we provide a C++ runtime solution that encapsulates the operator‚Äôs wrapper logic, registration mechanism, and runtime management entirely in C++, while still reusing the underlying Triton kernels for the actual computation. This approach maintains Triton's kernel-level efficiency while significantly reducing Python-related overhead, enabling tighter integration with low-level CUDA workflows and improving overall inference performance.

#### Installation & Setup

To use the C++ operator wrappers:

1. **Follow the [Installation](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems/blob/master/docs/installation.md)** to compile and install the C++ version of `flag_gems`.

2. **Verify successful installation** with the following snippet:

   ```
    try:
        from flag_gems import c_operators
        has_c_extension = True
    except Exception as e:
        c_operators = None  # avoid import error if c_operators is not available
        has_c_extension = False
   ```

   If `has_c_extension` is `True`, then the C++ runtime path is available.

3. When installed successfully, C++ wrappers will automatically be preferred **in patch mode** and when explicitly building models using `flag_gems`-defined modules. For example, `gems_rms_forward` will by default use the C++ wrapper version of `rms_norm`. You can refer to the actual usage in [normalization.py](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems/blob/master/src/flag_gems/modules/normalization.py#L46) to better understand how C++ operator wrappers are integrated and invoked.

#### Explicitly Using C++ Operators

If you want to **directly call C++-wrapped operators**, bypassing any patch logic or fallback, use the `torch.ops.flag_gems` namespace like this:

```
output = torch.ops.flag_gems.fused_add_rms_norm(...)
```

This gives you **precise control** over operator dispatch, which can be beneficial in performance-sensitive contexts.

#### Currently Supported C++-Wrapped Operators

| Operator Name        | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `add`                | Element-wise addition                    |
| `bmm`                | Batch Matrix Multiplication              |
| `cat`                | Concatenate                              |
| `fused_add_rms_norm` | Fused addition + RMSNorm                 |
| `mm`                 | Matrix multiplication                    |
| `nonzero`            | Returns the indices of non-zero elements |
| `rms_norm`           | Root Mean Square normalization           |
| `rotary_embedding`   | Rotary position embedding                |
| `sum`                | Reduction across dimensions              |

We are actively expanding this list as part of our ongoing performance roadmap.
