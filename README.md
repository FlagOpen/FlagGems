## Introduction

FlagGems is a high-performance general operator library implemented in [OpenAI Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton). It aims to provide a suite of kernel functions to accelerate LLM training and inference.  

By registering with the ATen backend of PyTorch, FlagGems facilitates a seamless transition, allowing users to switch to the Triton function library without the need to modify their model code. Users can still utilize the ATen backend as usual while experiencing significant performance enhancement. The Triton language offers benefits in readability, user-friendliness and performance comparable to CUDA. This convenience allows developers to engage in the development of FlagGems with minimal learning investment.  


## Changelog

### v1.0
- support BLAS operators: addmm, bmm, mm  
- support pointwise operators: abs, add, div, dropout, exp, gelu, mul, pow, reciprocal, relu, rsqrt, silu, sub, triu  
- support reduction operators: cumsum, layernorm, mean, softmax  

## Quick Start

### Requirements

1. Triton >= 2.2.0  
2. PyTorch >= 2.1.2  
3. Transformers >= 4.31.0  

### Installation  

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagGems.git
cd FlagGems
pip install .
```

## Usage  

### Import

1. Enable permanently  
    ```python
    import flag_gems
    flag_gems.enable()
    ```

2. Enable temporarily  
    ```python
    import flag_gems
    with flag_gems.use_gems():
        pass
    ```

3. Example  
    ```python
    import torch
    import flag_gems

    M, N, K = 1024, 1024, 1024
    A = torch.randn((M, K), dtype=torch.float16, device="cuda")
    B = torch.randn((K, N), dtype=torch.float16, device="cuda")
    with flag_gems.use_gems():
        C = torch.mm(A, B)
    ```
