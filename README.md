## Introduction

FlagGems is a high-performance general operator library implemented in [OpenAI Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton). It builds on a collection of backend neutral kernels that aims to accelerate LLM training and inference across diverse hardware platforms.

By registering with the ATen backend of PyTorch, FlagGems facilitates a seamless transition, allowing model developers to switch to Triton without changing the low level APIs. Users can still use their familiar Pytorch APIs as usual and benefit from new hardware acceleration technologies. For kernel developers, the Triton language offers readability, user-friendliness and performance comparable to CUDA. This convenience allows developers to engage in the development of FlagGems with minimal learning investment.

## Features

FlagGems provides the following technical features.

- A large collection of PyTorch compatible operators
- Hand optimized performance for selective operators
- Eager mode ready, independent of `torch.compile`
- Automatic pointwise operator codegen supporting arbitrary input types and layout
- Fast per-function runtime kernel dispatching
- Multi-backend interface enabling support of diverse hardware platforms
- Over 10 supported backends
- C++ Triton function dispatcher (working in progress)

## More About Features

### Multi-Backend Hardware Support

FlagGems supports a wide range of hardware platforms and has been extensively tested across different hardware configurations.

### Automatic Codegen

FlagGems provides an automatic code generation mechanism that enables developers to easily generate both pointwise and fused operators.
The auto-generation system supports a variety of needs, including standard element-wise computations, non-tensor parameters, and specifying output types.
For more details, please refer to [pointwise_dynamic](docs/pointwise_dynamic.md).

### LibEntry

FlagGems introduces `LibEntry`, which independently manages the kernel cache and bypasses the runtime of `Autotuner`, `Heuristics`, and `JitFunction`. To use it, simply decorate the Triton kernel with LibEntry.

`LibEntry` also supports direct wrapping of `Autotuner`, `Heuristics`, and `JitFunction`, preserving full tuning functionality. However, it avoids nested runtime type invocations, eliminating redundant parameter processing. This means no need for binding or type wrapping, resulting in a simplified cache key format and reduced unnecessary key computation.

### C++ Runtime

FlagGems can be installed either as a pure Python package or as a package with C++ extensions. The C++ runtime is designed to address the overhead of the Python runtime and improve end-to-end performance.
